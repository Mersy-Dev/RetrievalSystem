      "sweatingDesc": "Profuse sweating, especially after fever episodes.",
      "sweatingDetails": "Sweating typically follows the fever and chills stage. This is the body’s attempt to cool itself down and maintain normal temperature after sudden spikes.",

      "fatigueTitle": "Severe Fatigue",
      "fatigueDesc": "Extreme tiredness, weakness, and lack of energy.",
      "fatigueDetails": "Fatigue results from the destruction of red blood cells and the energy demands of the immune system fighting the infection. Patients often feel drained even with minimal activity.",

      "chillsTitle": "Chills & Shivering",
