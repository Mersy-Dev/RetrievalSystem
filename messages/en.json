      "introMala": "Malaria is a serious but preventable disease caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It remains a major public health concern in many tropical and subtropical regions, including Nigeria. With early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and effective prevention measures, malaria can be controlled and lives can be saved.",

      "feverTitle": "High Fever",
      "feverDesc": "A sudden rise in body temperature, often recurring in cycles.",
      "feverDetails": "High fever is the hallmark symptom of malaria. The fever often comes in cycles, accompanied by chills and sweating. It results from the parasite maturing inside red blood cells and causing their rupture.",

      "sweatingTitle": "Excessive Sweating",
      "sweatingDesc": "Profuse sweating, especially after fever episodes.",
      "sweatingDetails": "Sweating typically follows the fever and chills stage. This is the body’s attempt to cool itself down and maintain normal temperature after sudden spikes.",

      "fatigueTitle": "Severe Fatigue",
      "fatigueDesc": "Extreme tiredness, weakness, and lack of energy.",
      "fatigueDetails": "Fatigue results from the destruction of red blood cells and the energy demands of the immune system fighting the infection. Patients often feel drained even with minimal activity.",

      "chillsTitle": "Chills & Shivering",
      "chillsDesc": "Sudden cold sensations and shaking chills.",
      "chillsDetails": "Chills usually appear before fever spikes. They are caused by the parasite bursting out of red blood cells and triggering the body’s inflammatory response.",

      "anemiaTitle": "Anemia",
      "anemiaDesc": "Paleness, dizziness, and weakness due to loss of red blood cells.",
      "anemiaDetails": "Anemia in malaria patients is a result of massive destruction of red blood cells by parasites. Severe anemia can lead to complications, especially in children and pregnant women.",

      "otherTitle": "Other Symptoms",
      "otherDesc": "Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pains.",
      "otherDetails": "Other associated symptoms include abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, nausea, and muscle aches. Severe cases can involve neurological symptoms such as confusion or seizures.",

      "details1": "The first signs of malaria are usually fever, headache, and chills. These symptoms may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria.",
      "details2": "If not treated within 24 hours, malaria can progress to severe illness and often death. Severe malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum and can lead to complications like breathing problems, organ failure, and convulsions.",
      "details3": "Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications. Always seek medical advice if you experience these symptoms after visiting or living in malaria-prone areas."
